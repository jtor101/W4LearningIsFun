Learning Is Fun

My Learning Is Fun, which allows users to search through all courses offered by a fictional community center, by category or by showing all courses.  The user can then view more details about the course and register for the course.  Registered users appear on a table underneath the details table.

Due to my time constaints on this particular weekly project, my sole goal was to make it functional.  There's still an error in the dynamic html that I have to figure out, and forms do not have validation. I will be updating this further after the weekend.
