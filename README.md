Learning Is Fun

My Learning Is Fun, which allows users to search through all courses offered by a fictional community center, by category or by showing all courses.  The user can then view more details about the course and register for the course.  Registered users appear on a table underneath the details table.

Due to my time constaints on this particular weekly project, my sole goal was to make it functional.  I was very disappointed that I could not figure out the one error in my dynamic html.  Next week will be better.
